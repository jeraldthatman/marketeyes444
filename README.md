This repo is meant to highlight the methods use to download options data from yahoo finance using the yfinance package in python. I have been gathering data since November of 2021, and have used this data to create my own screener, and visualize important aspects of a stock's deriviative transactions, such as call and put percantages over time, as well as open interest per expiration. All of the code here is 100% FREE and compiled form 100% FREE Resources.

Bringing you the data daily - stay nimble my friends 
cheers
